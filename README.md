## Controls  

- **Keyboard**:  
  - `Spacebar`, `W`, `ArrowUp`: Jump  
- **Mouse**:  
  - Click anywhere on the screen to jump.

## Game Logic  

- **Gravity**:  
  - Gravity continuously pulls the bird down.  
  - Jumping gives the bird an upward velocity to counteract gravity.  

- **Obstacles**:  
  - Obstacles move from right to left.  
  - New obstacles appear once the old ones vanish.  

- **Level Progression**:  
  - Clearing all obstacles increases the level.  
  - The current level is displayed at the top of the screen.  

- **Collision Detection**:  
  - If the bird touches an obstacle or the ground, the game ends.
